              <div class="card-body">
                Orignally from St. Louis, I moved to Chicago in 2009. While
                there, I explored many career options. I started with a role in
                Finance and moved from to a role in Recruiting. The role in
                recruiting with Capital One provided me the opportunity to
                relocate to San Francisco to set up the recruiting office in the
                new San Francisco office.
                <br />
                <br />
                I have been in the Bay Area since 2014. Started with Capital
                One, I moved Cisco in 2016 and have held a variety of roles. I
                currently live in the Alamo Square neigborhood in the city.
                <br />
                <br />
                Some of my favorite things to do in the city are to explore
                different neighborhoods, try new restaurants, and spending time
                at the beach. Outside of San Francisco activities, I love to
                travel. I have been to many countries, states, cities, my
                favorite of all being Egypt.
                <br />
                <br />
                The dog in the picture is my puppy Nugget. She's 12 years old
                and has been with me since she was puppy. She's a well traveled
                dog, having been to Chicago, Cleveland, San Francisco,
                Pascadena, Columbia MO, and Dallas.

              <div class="card-body">
                I've always enjoyed a puzzle, and to me that's what coding is.
                During college, I took an Excel class as required part of my
                major where we learned VBA. Since then, I've poked around on
                codeacademy.com.
                <br />
                <br />
                When I started with OpenDNS right after they were acquired by
                Cisco, I was on the recruiting team. I moved over to the
                customer success department to assist with onboarding new
                customers. I learned about DNS and how the internet works. We
                have Hackathons twice a year, and the first one I participated
                in I didn't have a project I was working on. One of the
                engineers taught a Python class. It was so much fun, I just
                wanted to keep learning.
                <br />
                <br />
                The role I'm currently in doesn't offer much in the means of
                coding. It's a project based job, so sometimes I have downtime.
                I was curious one day about taking a bootcamp to learn to code.
                I googled coding bootcamps, and found a course through the
                University of Berkeley's extension program. It sounded perfect.
                <br />
                <br />
                So far, I've gotten the chance to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                and jQuery. I've gotten to practice with many different and
                intersting projects, some featured on my portfolio page.
                Additionally, I got the experience of working in a group to
                build a really fun games app. I'm loving learning to code and
                would love to move into a role that allows for more coding and
                problem solving.
